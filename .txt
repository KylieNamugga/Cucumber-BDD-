WHAT IS CUCUMBER?
Cucumber is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development.
It reads executable specifications written in plain text and 
validates that the software does what those specifications say.
The specifications consist of multiple examples which we call scenarios. 

Each scenario is a list of steps for Cucumber to work through. 
Cucumber verifies that the software conforms with the specification and generates a report
indicating success or failure for each scenario.

Now In order for Cucumber to understand the scenarios, 
they must follow some basic syntax rules, called Gherkin.
Gherkin is a set of grammar rules that makes plain text structured enough 
for Cucumber to understand and hence execute.

STEPS
The first step is to create a new directory called cucumber.
Then install your package manager and install cucumber as a dev dependency.
Don't forget to change your test to cucumber-js as we you do with Mocha in TDD.
In your root folder, add a features folder, .gitignore file for your node modules and a cucumber.js file.
In your features folder, create a file called "totalAmountSpent.feature" this while hold our scenario.
Create another folder called "step_definitions" and within it create a file called "stepdefs.js".
Let's run our tests.
